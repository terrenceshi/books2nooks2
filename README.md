# To do:

- run through yenho code and see if you can output everything as a csv
    - 6 playlists for each book
    - each book should be about 24 kb
    - with 16k books, should be looking at 384 mb
    - not completely fucked...

- once mega csv is created, should create code to just
    - get index of song
    - set playlist info to useState
    - create spotify playlist if not created yet
    - display data
